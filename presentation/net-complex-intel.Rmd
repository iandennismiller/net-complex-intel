# social psychology meets artificial intelligence | diving into the academic social network

## Academic collaboration network {.side-image}

![10th Macy Conference group photo](assets/macy-10th-conference.jpg)

- Lewin and von Neumann meet at Macy 1 and 2:
    - March 1946
    - October 1946
- consider that moment in time as a starting point
- imagine spidering their social networks
- social network with one particular constraint:
    + authors must be linked via co-authorship

## Leveraging BibTeX {.side-image}

![some example BibTeX](assets/bibtex.png)

- database of citations
- BibTeX is the interchange format
    + read/write citations
    + compatible with everything
        - R
        - Python
        - LaTeX
    + ugly, but good enough
- my Zotero library consists of $n \approx$ 2500 citations
    + autoexport plugin syncs a .bib file

## Visualizing the network | [http://imiller.utsc.utoronto.ca/media/network/](http://imiller.utsc.utoronto.ca/media/network/) {.side-image}

<img src="assets/academic-network.png" style="height: 400px;" />

- identify the largest component
    + $n_{authors} = 1574$
    + $n_{edges} = 4905$
- look at 2nd-largest component for authors who are missing a link
    + library is curated, not randomly sampled
- calculate modularity (stochastic) to identify communities
    + $n_{communities} = 34$

## Insights {.side-image}

![The missing link?](assets/feynman.png)

- citation data "in the wild" are very poor quality
- the communities (detected by modularity) seem plausible
- some communities resisted collaboration
    + Royal Society
    + US and UK WWII computer scientists
    + CS and Psychology sides of AI
- von Neumann is *very* distantly connected to Lewin's students
    + Lewin's death may have dashed any chances of a collaboration

# pub2 | a brief interlude on the subject of online scholarship

## What is publication? {.side-image .bigger}

![an article](assets/article.png)

- publication in 2016, that is
- where do you publish?
- where do you find articles?
- **pub2**: a system for self-publishing
    + all you need is a PDF and a .bib file that links to it

## where do you publish? {.side-image}

![Hoe's one cylidner printing press](assets/printing-press.png)

+ books
+ conferences
    * proceedings
    * presentations
+ journals
    * science-wide
    * discipline-specific
+ pre-publication:
    - arXiv
    - SSRN
    - fooXiv
- **self-publication??**

## where do you find articles? {.side-image .bigger}

![Bibliothek St. Florian](assets/library.jpg)

- citeseer/citeulike/worldcat
- pubmed/government portal
- publisher search (ha!)
- open journals
- university or public library
- Google scholar
    - warning: you will be rate-limited

## self-publication {.side-image .bigger}

![Zines](assets/zines.jpg)

- goal: get BibTeX indexed by Google Scholar
- digital object identifier?
- serve it yourself.  Google don't care
- archival format
    + HTML?
    + PDF
- **pub2** is a system for making this realistic

## pub2 {.side-image}

![pub2 source](assets/pub2-src.png)

- like Jekyll (static site generator) for PDFs
    - generates PDF and .bib file that links to PDF
    - simple LaTeX isn't so different from Markdown
    - YAML preamble/templating like Jekyll
    - actually sits on top of an existing Jekyll install
- more info
    + `pip install pub2`
    + http://pub2.readthedocs.io

# gh-impact | the influence of Individuals and Organizations in open source software

## Overview {.side-image .bigger}

![Tall Trees](assets/trees.jpg)

- What is gh-impact?
- Where does gh-impact come from?
- Who does gh-impact apply to?
- Why does gh-impact matter?
- How can I use gh-impact?

## What is **gh-impact**? {.side-image .bigger}

![Stone](assets/stone-palm.jpg)

- captures breadth and depth of project use on GitHub
- gh-impact score is n if there are n projects with n stars
    - ex: 1, 1, 1 = 1
    - ex: 1, 2, 3 = 2
- "gh" stands for "good & hot"

## Where does **gh-impact** come from? {.side-image .bigger}

![The open road](assets/road.jpg)

- related to academic citation analysis ("bibliometrics")
- GitHub public data API
- GHTorrent data dumps
- own custom statistics pipeline

## Who does **gh-impact** apply to? {.side-image .bigger}

![Crowd of people](assets/crowd.jpg)

- all accounts on GitHub
- individuals and organizations
- must have at least one star to have a **gh-impact** score
- not just software: websites, curation, science ...

## Why does **gh-impact** matter? {.side-image .bigger}

![Science, generally](assets/calculator.jpg)

- assess productive output of accounts
- get credit for open source work (e.g. academics)
- **gh-impact** is a key metric for developing other analyses
- intelligence about open source software

## How can I use **gh-impact**? {.side-image .bigger}

![People discussing things](assets/work.jpg)

- search: **gh-impact** scores for over 1.1 million accounts
- analysis: results from ongoing statistical analysis are regularly posted
- open data: download raw JSON from GitHub
- http://www.gh-impact.com

## Conclusion {.side-image .bigger}

![The future, figuratively](assets/future-road.jpg)

- gh-impact is a measure of influence on GitHub
- similar to how influence is measured in academia
- describes both individual and organization GitHub accounts
- gain intelligence about open source software
- search, analysis, and data on http://www.gh-impact.com
