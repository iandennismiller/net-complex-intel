# Social Psychology meets Artificial Intelligence | diving into the academic social network

## Academic collaboration network {.side-image}

![10th Macy Conference group photo](assets/coauthorship/macy-10th-conference.jpg)

- Lewin and von Neumann meet at Macy 1 and 2:
    - March 1946
    - October 1946
- consider that moment in time as a starting point
- imagine spidering their social networks
- social network with one particular constraint:
    + authors must be linked via co-authorship

## Leveraging BibTeX {.side-image}

![some example BibTeX](assets/stock/bibtex.png)

- database of citations
- BibTeX is the interchange format
    + read/write citations
    + compatible with everything
        - R
        - Python
        - LaTeX
    + ugly, but good enough
- my Zotero library consists of $n \approx$ 2500 citations
    + autoexport plugin syncs a .bib file

## Visualizing the network | [http://imiller.utsc.utoronto.ca/media/network/](http://imiller.utsc.utoronto.ca/media/network/) {.side-image}

<img src="assets/coauthorship/academic-network.png" style="height: 400px;" />

- identify the largest component
    + $n_{authors} = 1574$
    + $n_{edges} = 4905$
- look at 2nd-largest component for authors who are missing a link
    + library is curated, not randomly sampled
- calculate modularity (stochastic) to identify communities
    + $n_{communities} = 34$

## Insights {.side-image}

![The missing link?](assets/coauthorship/feynman.png)

- citation data "in the wild" are very poor quality
- the communities (detected by modularity) seem plausible
- some communities resisted collaboration
    + Royal Society
    + US and UK WWII computer scientists
    + CS and Psychology sides of AI
- von Neumann is *very* distantly connected to Lewin's students
    + Lewin's death may have dashed any chances of a collaboration

# Pub2 | a brief interlude on the subject of online scholarship

## What is publication? {.side-image .bigger}

![an article](assets/stock/article.png)

- publication in 2016, that is
- where do you publish?
- where do you find articles?
- **pub2**: a system for self-publishing
    + all you need is a PDF and a .bib file that links to it

## Where do you publish? {.side-image}

![Hoe's one cylidner printing press](assets/stock/printing-press.png)

+ books
+ conferences
    * proceedings
    * presentations
+ journals
    * science-wide
    * discipline-specific
+ pre-publication:
    - arXiv
    - SSRN
    - fooXiv
- **self-publication??**

## Where do you find articles? {.side-image .bigger}

![Bibliothek St. Florian](assets/stock/library.jpg)

- citeseer/citeulike/worldcat
- pubmed/government portal
- publisher search (ha!)
- open journals
- university or public library
- Google scholar
    - warning: you will be rate-limited

## Self-publication {.side-image .bigger}

![Zines](assets/stock/zines.jpg)

- goal: get BibTeX indexed by Google Scholar
- digital object identifier?
- serve it yourself.  Google don't care
- archival format
    + HTML?
    + PDF
- **pub2** is a system for making this realistic

## Pub2 {.side-image}

![pub2 example source](assets/pub2/pub2-src.png)

- like Jekyll (static site generator) for PDFs
    - generates PDF and .bib file that links to PDF
    - simple LaTeX isn't so different from Markdown
    - YAML preamble/templating like Jekyll
    - actually sits on top of an existing Jekyll install
- more info
    + `pip install pub2`
    + http://pub2.readthedocs.io

# gh-impact | the influence of Individuals and Organizations in open source software

## Overview {.side-image .bigger}

![Tall Trees](assets/stock/trees.jpg)

- What is gh-impact?
- Where does gh-impact come from?
- Who does gh-impact apply to?
- Why does gh-impact matter?
- How can I use gh-impact?

## What is **gh-impact**? {.side-image .bigger}

![Stone](assets/stock/stone-palm.jpg)

- gh-impact is a measure of influence on GitHub.
- Accounts that publish lots of popular projects will have higher gh-impact scores.
- captures breadth and depth of project use on GitHub
- gh-impact score is n if there are n projects with n stars
    - ex: 1, 1, 1 = 1
    - ex: 1, 2, 3 = 2
- "gh" stands for "good & hot"

## Where does **gh-impact** come from? {.side-image .bigger}

![The open road](assets/stock/road.jpg)

- related to academic citation analysis ("bibliometrics")
- GitHub public data API
- GHTorrent data dumps
- own custom statistics pipeline

## Who does **gh-impact** apply to? {.side-image .bigger}

![Crowd of people](assets/stock/crowd.jpg)

- all accounts on GitHub
- individuals and organizations
- must have at least one star to have a **gh-impact** score
- not just software: websites, curation, science ...

## Why does **gh-impact** matter? {.side-image .bigger}

![Science, generally](assets/stock/calculator.jpg)

- assess productive output of accounts
- get credit for open source work (e.g. academics)
- **gh-impact** is a key metric for developing other analyses
- intelligence about open source software

## How can I use **gh-impact**? {.side-image .bigger}

![People discussing things](assets/stock/work.jpg)

- search: **gh-impact** scores for over 1.1 million accounts
- analysis: results from ongoing statistical analysis are regularly posted
- open data: download raw JSON from GitHub
- http://www.gh-impact.com

## Conclusion {.side-image .bigger}

![The future, figuratively](assets/stock/future-road.jpg)

- gh-impact is a measure of influence on GitHub
- similar to how influence is measured in academia
- describes both individual and organization GitHub accounts
- gain intelligence about open source software
- search, analysis, and data on http://www.gh-impact.com

# Memelab | human behaviour, viral phenomena, and social simulation

## Memes

- this is where I started in 2011
- Dawkins (1976): cultural replicator

# topoli | individuals, group influence, and political memes

## topoli {.side-image .bigger}

- a hash tag is used to channel tweets towards interested audiences
- topoli = toronto politics
- #topoli used to discuss municipal politics related to Toronto.
- analogous hashtags #onpoli and #capoli

## Twitter sample {.side-image .bigger}

- observed 1,276,077 tweets between Nov 2013 - January 2015
- 832,889 imported so far
- 474,831 original (non-retweet) tweets
- 82,874 agents have been observed tweeting

## Where are they? {.side-image .bigger}

![topoli participants are in Toronto](assets/topoli/map.png)

- of the 82,874 participating, 52,517 (63%) reported some location information
- of the 52,517 who reported something:
    - 15,752 (30%) included “toronto” in location
    - 8,420 (16%) included “canada” in location
- but the GPS speaks for itself

## topoli in 3-gram phrases

frequency   frequency minus “stopwords” pointwise mutual information (PMI)
mayor rob ford  looking forward to  the gravy train
at city hall    mayor of toronto    the island airport
topoli rob ford toronto mayoral race    little red apples
rob ford topoli city of toronto a speedy recovery
topoli john tory    this is the the shirtless jogger

## method for selecting n-grams

only original tweets
remove retweets (which inflate n-gram frequency)
PMI is like chi-square
how often did we observe the n-gram versus expected number of observations
results: the n-grams that are co-original (not duplicates)

## and the memes are...

- “the gravy train”
    + a campaign slogan in 2010
    + a reference to government spending
- “the island airport”
    + there’s actually an airport right downtown
    + construction is hotly contested
- “little red apples”
    + “It doesn't have to be about race.  You can be a racist against people that eat little red apples.”
    + (this was spoken by Rob Ford’s brother)
- “a speedy recovery”
    + following Rob Ford’s cancer announcement
    + many people expressed a similar sentiment
- the shirtless jogger
