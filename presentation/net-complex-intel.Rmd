# social psychology meets artificial intelligence

## Academic collaboration network {.side-image}

![10th Macy Conference](assets/macy-10th-conference.jpg)

- Lewin and von Neumann meet at Macy 1 and 2:
    - March 1946
    - October 1946
- consider that moment in time as a starting point
- imagine spidering their social networks
- social net with one particular constraint
    + authors are linked via co-authorship

## Leveraging BibTeX {.side-image}

![BibTeX](assets/bibtex.png)

- database of citations
- BibTeX is the interchange format
    + read/write citations
    + compatible with everything
        - R
        - Python
        - LaTeX
    + ugly, but good enough
- library consists of $n \approx$ 2500 citations

## Visualizing the network {.side-image}

![Academic collaboration network](assets/academic-network.png)

- identify the largest component
    + $n_{authors} = 1574$
    + $n_{edges} = 4905$
- look at 2nd-largest component for authors who are missing a link
- calculate modularity (stochastic) to identify communities
